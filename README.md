# Elite Dangerous Dual Joysticks Bindings

These are my keybindings for using a dual joystick setup in Elite Dangerous. Feel free to use them as is, or modify them to suit your needs.

I chose to go with two Mad Catz Cyborg V.1 sticks, as they are ambidextrous and offer a good amount of buttons that are reachable without having to remove your hands from the sticks. Each stick has a hat switch and seven buttons in total: the trigger, five thumb buttons, and one grip button which can be squeezed with either your pinky or ring finger. I have included a diagram of the flight controls below, the driving controls are similar, and some of the lesser used binds were assigned to the keyboard. The galaxy map can be quickly browsed using the two hat switches, but any extensive browsing or searching requires the mouse and keyboard.

My bindings are derived from [/u/nmezib's bindings](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/2s3y1w/my_dual_joystick_setup_for_elite_dangerous_or_how/).
